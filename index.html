              <h3>Córdoba de la Nueva Andalucía</h3>
              <p>
                Córdoba is the second largest city in Argentina. It was founded
                by Spanish conquistador, Jeronimo Luis de Cabrera, who named it
                Córdoba de la Nueva Andalucía, after the Spanish city with the
                same name, due to its similar geographic characteristics.
                <br />
                Córdoba is is known for its rich colonial heritage, a rich
                cultural offer, which includes its own unique latin pop music
                genre, and a vibrant nightlife with a wide choice of bars,
                restaurants and craft fares.

                <p>
                  <em>Cuarteto,</em> a unique type of latin music, has given
                  Córdoba a distinctive cultural identity. Created in the 1960s
                  by inmigrants fusing the rhythms of the Italian
                  <em>tarantella</em> and the Spanish <em>paso doble</em> in the
                  Creole working class areas, it is now a symbol of the province
                  reaching all sectors of society and spreading beyond the
                  shores of the province.
